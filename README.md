The Interview Video Analyzing Platform is a web-based application built with Streamlit that analyzes live video from a webcam to assess a candidateâ€™s behavior during an interview. The platform performs two types of analysis:

1.Eye Gaze Analysis - Detects whether the person is maintaining eye contact with the screen or looking away, which can be an indicator of attentiveness or engagement.


2.Mannerism Analysis - Detects facial expressions such as smiling, helping assess the candidate's emotional state and engagement during the interview.
This project leverages computer vision techniques using libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit to create an interactive experience for video analysis in real-time.
